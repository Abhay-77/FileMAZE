### Project Description
FileMAZE is a completely useless file renamer that transforms your directory into a confusing, riddle-filled labyrinth. Every file and folder is renamed into a trivia question, absurd riddle, or anime-level nonsense - and it just keeps getting worse.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Navigating your files is too easy, too predictable. Why find resume.docx in 2 seconds when you could embark on an existential trivia quest?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We recursively rename your entire folder structure using AI-generated riddles, trivia, and themed nonsense. With modes like Pirate, Shakespeare, and Anime - confusion is guaranteed. 

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Languages: Python
- Frameworks: PySide6 (for GUI)
- Libraries:
    - pyinstaller for app packaging
    - os, threading, etc. for file chaos
    - Gemini API for question generation
